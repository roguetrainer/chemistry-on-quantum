#QuantumComputing ⚛️ for #QuantumChemistry 🧪

🚂 Toy project using the 🎛️ Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to find the ground state energy of the 🫧 Hydrogen molecule ($\text{H}_2$).

This project is a demo of a hybrid quantum-classical approach leveraging a quantum circuit (the UCCSD Ansatz) to prepare the molecular state and a classical optimizer to minimize the energy.

Key Technologies Used:

PennyLane: For building the differentiable quantum circuit and QNode (from Xanadu)

QChem Module: To efficiently generate the molecular Hamiltonian ($\hat{H}$) for $\text{H}_2$ in the minimal basis set.

If you're interested in the intersection of molecular simulation and NISQ-era quantum algorithms, try the Python code, methodology, and setup scripts below.
